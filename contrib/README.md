# PowerBOFH Excuse Contributions
Would you like to contribute some BOFH excuses?  By all means, let's include them!

## What To Contribute
To contribute to this module, go find some BOFH excuses online.  Sources include [The Register's BOFH Archive](https://www.theregister.com/offbeat/bofh/) and [The Complete BOFH Archives 1995-1999](http://www.bofharchive.com/), but anything canonical is welcomed.

At this time, we are not accepting quotes that did not appear in a BOFH story, post, or other media.  Generally, if Simon Travaglia wrote it, it's fair game for inclusion.

## Currently-Contributed Files
*  **JeffBallard.txt** contains all of the excuses from Jeff Ballard's BOFH server.
*  **PowerBOFH.txt** includes the default error "excuse" from v1, as well as a line about onion bhajis that I found funny.

## Excuse File Format
Excuse files are plain text.  They:

1.  MUST be encoded with UTF-8.
2.  MUST end with a `.txt` extension.
3.  MUST contain one excuse per line (that is, multi-line excuses are not supported).
4.  SHOULD use CR+LF line endings for cross-platform compatibility.
5.  SHOULD NOT end with a blank line.
6.  SHOULD have a file name that identifies the source.
