## PowerBOFH
If you work in the <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> field, you know that you often need to find an excuse, and find one fast.  This module comes pre-loaded with excuses taken from [Jeff Ballard's BOFH server](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ballard/bofh/) and other BOFHly sources.

````powershell
PS C:\> Get-Excuse
```
```output
It's a hard computer science problem.
````

### How can I get this module?
Most BOFH's will want to grab this cross-platform module from the PowerShell Gallery.
````powershell
PS C:\> Install-Module PowerBOFH
````

You could also download a release from this GitHub page.  Bleeding-edge BOFH's may prefer to clone the Git repository.

### What does <abbr title="Bastard Operator From Hell">BOFH</abbr> stand for?
Google it.

### Am I a BOFH?
If you're installing this module, you might be.

### Do you know Jeff Ballard?
No, nor is this module related to him or his service in any way, shape, form, or hash collision.  Prior to version 2.0.0, this module relied on his server, and I thank him for letting me use it without permission.
