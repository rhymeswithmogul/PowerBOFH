# Contributing to PowerBOFH

We are always accepting contributions from the open-source community.

## Excuses

Please see [contrib/README.md](`contrib/README.md`) for more information on how to contribute excuses.  There's a process.

## Code

All code contributed should be optimized for the latest version of PowerShell (currently 7.3.0), but should still run on Windows PowerShell 5.1.
