SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Bastard Operator From Hell.  We all know the bitter, secluded system admin
	that is so sick of people pestering him that he would all too eagerly delete
	all your accounts, just because he can.  BOFHs are usually operators long
	enough in the business to have lost all sense of respect for the maggots
	that keep calling him about their broken computers.

	Do not anger the BOFH, for he has root access.

LONG DESCRIPTION SHAMELESSLY COPIED FROM WIKIPEDIA
	The Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH) is a fictional rogue computer operator
	created by Simon Travaglia, who takes out his anger on users (who are
	"lusers" to him) and others who pester him with their computer problems,
	uses his expertise against his enemies and manipulates his employer.

	Several other people have written stories about BOFHs, but those by Simon
	Travaglia are considered canonical. The BOFH stories were originally posted 
	n 1992 to Usenet by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in Datamation.
	They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in Network Week.  Since 2000,
	they have been published regularly in The Register (UK). Several collections
	of the stories have been published as books.

	By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who
	displays the qualities of the original.
